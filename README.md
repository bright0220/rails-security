# Zen Rails Security Checklist

## Summary
This document provides a list of security measures to be implemented when 
developing a Ruby on Rails application. It is designed to serve as a quick 
reference and minimize vulnerabilities caused by developer forgetfulness.

This is meant to be a community-driven resource. Your contributions 
[contributinon](#contributing) are welcome! 

This checklist is not meant to contain in-depth descriptions of 
each vulnerability and their countermeasures. If that is what you are looking
 for, see the links in the
[References and Further Reading](#references-and-further-reading) section.

**Disclaimer**: Implementing these security measures may minimize the 
vulnerability of your Rails application. However, there is no way to cover 
all possible attack vectors. This guide does not cover OS-related 
vulnerabilities. The [author](#authors) is a Rails developer, not a security 
expert.
